## 3. Run the starting sample app

First, let's see what the starting sample app looks like. Follow these instructions to open the sample app in Android Studio.

1. If you downloaded the `kotlin-coroutines` zip file, unzip the file.
2. Open the `advanced-coroutines-codelab` directory in Android Studio.
3. Make sure `start` is selected in the configuration drop-down.
4. Click the **Run** ![execute.png](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/advanced-kotlin-coroutines/img/c8b8a080b7ead886.png) button, and either choose an emulated device or connect your Android device. The device must be capable of running Android Lollipop (the minimum supported SDK is 21).

When the app first runs, a list of cards appears, each displaying the name and image of a specific plant:

Each `Plant` has a `growZoneNumber`, an attribute that represents the region where the plant is most likely to thrive. Users can tap the filter icon ![ee1895257963ae84.png](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/advanced-kotlin-coroutines/img/ee1895257963ae84.png) to toggle between showing all plants and plants for a specific grow zone, which is hardcoded to zone 9. Press the filter button a few times to see this in action.

## Architecture overview

This app uses [Architecture Components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture) to separate the UI code in `MainActivity` and `PlantListFragment` from the application logic in `PlantListViewModel`. `PlantRepository` provides a bridge between the `ViewModel` and `PlantDao`, which accesses the `Room` database to return a list of `Plant` objects. The UI then takes this list of plants and displays them in `RecyclerView` grid layout.

**A Repository is a bridge between a ViewModel and the data**

In addition to being the bridge, a repository can be accessed by any ViewModel that wants to use its logic. It can also combine the logic from multiple data sources, which we will be implemented later.

Before we start modifying the code, let's take a quick look at how the data flows from the database to the UI. Here is how the list of plants are loaded in the `ViewModel`:

### PlantListViewModel.kt

```
val plants: LiveData<List<Plant>> = growZone.switchMap { growZone ->
    if (growZone == NoGrowZone) {
        plantRepository.plants
    } else {
        plantRepository.getPlantsWithGrowZone(growZone)
    }
}
```

A `GrowZone` is an inline class that only contains an `Int` representing its zone. `NoGrowZone` represents the absence of a zone, and is only used for filtering.

### Plant.kt

```
inline class GrowZone(val number: Int)
val NoGrowZone = GrowZone(-1)
```

The `growZone` is toggled when the filter button is tapped. We use a [`switchMap`](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/lifecycle/Transformations.html#switchMap(androidx.lifecycle.LiveData, androidx.arch.core.util.Function>)) to determine the list of plants to return.

A `switchMap` applies a given function to the input `LiveData` (`growZone` in this case) and returns the transformed result as a `LiveData`.

Here is what the repository and Data Access Object (DAO) look like for fetching the plant data from the database:

### PlantDao.kt

```
@Query("SELECT * FROM plants ORDER BY name")
fun getPlants(): LiveData<List<Plant>>

@Query("SELECT * FROM plants WHERE growZoneNumber = :growZoneNumber ORDER BY name")
fun getPlantsWithGrowZoneNumber(growZoneNumber: Int): LiveData<List<Plant>>
```

### PlantRepository.kt

```
val plants = plantDao.getPlants()

fun getPlantsWithGrowZone(growZone: GrowZone) =
    plantDao.getPlantsWithGrowZoneNumber(growZone.number)
```

While most of the code modifications are in `PlantListViewModel` and `PlantRepository`, it's a good idea to take a moment to familiarize yourself with the structure of the project, focusing on how the plant data surfaces through the various layers from the database to the `Fragment`. In the next step, we'll modify the code to add custom sorting using the `LiveData` builder.

This codelab's app is based on the [Android Sunflower](https://github.com/android/sunflower) open source sample**Fun fact**: the `growZoneNumber` is loosely based on the United States Department of Agriculture's [Plant Hardiness Zone Map](https://planthardiness.ars.usda.gov/PHZMWeb/)
