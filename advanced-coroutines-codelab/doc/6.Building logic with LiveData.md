## 6. Building logic with LiveData

Now that the sorting logic is in place, replace the code for `plants` and `getPlantsWithGrowZone` with the `LiveData` [builder](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/coroutines#livedata) below:

### PlantRepository.kt

```
val plants: LiveData<List<Plant>> = liveData<List<Plant>> {
   val plantsLiveData = plantDao.getPlants()
   val customSortOrder = plantsListSortOrderCache.getOrAwait()
   emitSource(plantsLiveData.map {
       plantList -> plantList.applySort(customSortOrder) 
   })
}

fun getPlantsWithGrowZone(growZone: GrowZone) = liveData {
    val plantsGrowZoneLiveData = plantDao.getPlantsWithGrowZoneNumber(growZone.number)
    val customSortOrder = plantsListSortOrderCache.getOrAwait()
    emitSource(plantsGrowZoneLiveData.map { plantList -> 
        plantList.applySort(customSortOrder)
    })
}
```

Now if you run the app, the custom sorted plant list should appear:

The `LiveData` builder allows us to calculate values asynchronously, as `liveData` is backed by coroutines. Here we have a suspend function to fetch a `LiveData` list of plants from the database, while also calling a suspend function to get the custom sort order. We then combine these two values to sort the list of plants and return the value, all within the builder.

You can emit multiple values from a `LiveData` by calling the `emitSource()` function whenever you want to emit a new value. Note that each call to `emitSource()` removes the previously-added source.

The coroutine starts execution when it is observed, and is cancelled when the coroutine successfully finishes or if the either the database or network call fails.

If any of the suspend function calls fail, the entire block is canceled and not restarted, which helps avoid leaks.

In the next step,, we'll explore a variation of `getPlantsWithGrowZone` using a [Transformation](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/lifecycle/Transformations).
