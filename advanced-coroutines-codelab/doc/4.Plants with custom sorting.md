## 4. Plants with custom sorting

The list of plants are currently displayed in alphabetical order, but we want to change the order of this list by listing certain plants first, and then the rest in alphabetical order. This is similar to shopping apps displaying sponsored results at the top of a list of items available for purchase. Our product team wants the ability to change the sort order dynamically without shipping a new version of the app, so we'll fetch the list of plants to sort first from the backend.

Here's what the app will look like with custom sorting:

The custom sort order list consists of these four plants: Orange, Sunflower, Grape, and Avocado. Notice how they appear first in the list, then followed by the rest of the plants in alphabetical order.

Now if the filter button is pressed (and only `GrowZone` 9 plants are displayed), the Avocado disappears from the list since its `GrowZone` is not 9. The other three plants in the custom sort list are in `GrowZone` 9, so they'll remain at the top of the list. The only other plant in `GrowZone` 9 is the Tomato, which appears last in this list.

Let's start writing code to implement the custom sort.
