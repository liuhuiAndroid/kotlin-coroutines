## 5. Fetching sort order

We'll begin by writing a suspending function to fetch the custom sort order from the network and then cache it in memory.

Add the following to `PlantRepository`:

### PlantRepository.kt

```
private var plantsListSortOrderCache = 
    CacheOnSuccess(onErrorFallback = { listOf<String>() }) {
        plantService.customPlantSortOrder()
    }
```

`plantsListSortOrderCache` is used as the in-memory cache for the custom sort order. It will fallback to an empty list if there's a network error, so that our app can still display data even if the sorting order isn't fetched.

This code uses the `CacheOnSuccess` utility class provided in the `sunflower` module to handle caching. By abstracting away the details of implementing caching like this, the application code can be more straightforward. Since `CacheOnSuccess` is already well tested, we don't need to write as many tests for our repository to ensure the correct behavior. It's a good idea to introduce similar higher-level abstractions in your code when using `kotlinx-coroutines`.

Now let's incorporate some logic to apply the sort to a list of plants.

Add the following to `PlantRepository:`

### PlantRepository.kt

```
private fun List<Plant>.applySort(customSortOrder: List<String>): List<Plant> {
    return sortedBy { plant ->
        val positionForItem = customSortOrder.indexOf(plant.plantId).let { order ->
            if (order > -1) order else Int.MAX_VALUE
        }
        ComparablePair(positionForItem, plant.name)
    }
}
```

This extension function will rearrange the list, placing `Plants` that are in the `customSortOrder` at the front of the list.
