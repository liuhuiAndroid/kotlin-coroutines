## 1. Before you begin

In this codelab, you'll learn how to use the [`LiveData` builder](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/coroutines#livedata) to combine [Kotlin coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines-overview.html) with [`LiveData`](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata) in an Android app. We'll also use [Coroutines Asynchronous Flow](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines/flow.html) to implement the same thing, which is a coroutines library for representing an async sequence, or stream, of values.

[combine：联合，结合] [represent：代表；表现]

You'll start with an existing app, built using [Android Architecture Components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/), that uses `LiveData` to get a list of objects from a [`Room`](http://developer.android.com/room) database and display them in a `RecyclerView` grid layout.

Here are some code snippets to give you an idea of what you'll be doing. Here is the existing code to query the Room database:

[snippet：小片，片段]

```
val plants: LiveData<List<Plant>> = plantDao.getPlants()
```

The `LiveData` will be updated using the `LiveData` builder and coroutines with additional sorting logic:

[additional：附加的、额外的]

```
val plants: LiveData<List<Plant>> = liveData<List<Plant>> {
   val plantsLiveData = plantDao.getPlants()
   val customSortOrder = plantsListSortOrderCache.getOrAwait()
   emitSource(plantsLiveData.map { plantList -> plantList.applySort(customSortOrder) })
}
```

You'll also implement the same logic with `Flow`:

```
private val customSortFlow = plantsListSortOrderCache::getOrAwait.asFlow()

val plantsFlow: Flow<List<Plant>>
   get() = plantDao.getPlantsFlow()
       .combine(customSortFlow) { plants, sortOrder ->
           plants.applySort(sortOrder)
       }
       .flowOn(defaultDispatcher)
       .conflate()
```

## **Prerequisites**

- Experience with the Architecture Components `ViewModel`, `LiveData`, `Repository`, and `Room`.
- Experience with Kotlin syntax, including extension functions and lambdas.
- Experience with Kotlin Coroutines.
- A basic understanding of using threads on Android, including the main thread, background threads, and callbacks.

For an introduction to the Architecture Components used in this codelab, see [Room with a View](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/android-room-with-a-view-kotlin/#0).For an introduction to Kotlin syntax, see [Kotlin Bootcamp for Programmers](https://www.udacity.com/course/kotlin-bootcamp-for-programmers--ud9011).For an introduction to Kotlin Coroutines, see [Using Kotlin Coroutines in your Android App](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/kotlin-coroutines/)

## **What you'll do**

- Convert an existing `LiveData` to use the Kotlin coroutines-friendly `LiveData` builder.
- Add logic within a `LiveData` builder.
- Use `Flow` for asynchronous operations.
- Combine `Flows` and transform multiple asynchronous sources.
- Control concurrency with `Flows`.
- Learn how to choose between `LiveData` and `Flow.`

## What you'll need

- [Android Studio 3.5](https://developer.android.com/studio/) or above. The codelab may work with other versions, but some things might be missing or look different.

If you run into any issues (code bugs, grammatical errors, unclear wording, etc.) as you work through this codelab, please report the issue via the "Report a mistake" link in the lower left corner of the codelab.
